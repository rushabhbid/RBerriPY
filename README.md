Our team of four members have contributed to the making of this project.

# Question zero: Who doesn't like a webapp that helps them reach out to the government for solving their problems?
No one, really.

# Question one: Why use our product?
The product that we have designed has minimum user interaction, is extremely user-friendly, as we have used location retrieval directly by clicking on the map. Our product is fast to use, and hence appealing for the users to use it.

# Question two: What is the need for our product?
This project focuses on the problem of the local citizens facing some inevitable and prevailing issues in their day-to-day life and how should they be dealt with. 
The user signs up or logs in to find a feed of the problems that have been faced by other users, sorted by the level of severity of the project. The user can comment on the already lodged complaint, and hence increases the scope of the problem being solved. 

# How to use our product?
For lodging a complaint,
  >Click a photo of the issue(for eg. pothole or garbage)
  >Upload it to the webapp
  >Click on the location on the map where they are situated or where the issue is faced with. This adds a pin on the map showing the    location of the complaint.
  
The user can see the complaints with respect to his location and ward, where different types of complaints have their unique colour showed on the map.

The admin is able to see the issues, ordered by their severity, and their top comment based on the comment score(based on the number of upvotes) on their home page. They are given the rights to mark an issue as resolved. 
A pie chart denoting the number of overall issues launched over a period of time is also displayed. A map is also displayed to the admin to analyse what kind of complaints and how many complaints were issued in the areas all over Mumbai.

Hence, with this, we move towards a city that doesn't wait to become a better one, day by day.
